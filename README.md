# PyQt5-PTP-Project
The Pyqt5-PTP project adds a GUI (graphical user interface) as well as a series of other functionalities to bPTP - a Python implementation of PTP model for species delimitation, and makes the program compatible with Python 3. To see the original code of bPTP, please visit [link] (https://github.com/zhangjiajie/PTP).
This program delimits species on a rooted Newick or NEXUS tree format with no annotations on the tree. if input file contains multiple trees, only the first tree will be used.

Pyqt5-PTP has features like viewing the partition tree and table, along with exporting all the output files generated by the program in a folder. The original commandline functionality of original bPTP.py remains available and can be used.
Pyqt5-PTP furthermore implements the output of results in the .spart format, developed to provide a uniform and standardized format for species partition results.


# Features

* Viewing of partition table and tree on the GUI interface
* Spart format export option


# How to use it

* To open it as the original commandline tool, and use the bayesian delimitation method.  

```
python bPTP.py
```
To open it as the original commandline tool, and use file example/um_mftree.tre as sample file for the bootstrap sampling method of delimitation.
```
 python PTP.py

 ```

* To use it as GUI tool.

```
python advanced_ptp.py

```
